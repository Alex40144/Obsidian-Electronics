If we have a component which [[resistance]] varies in response to its environment changing, we use a [[Potential divider]] to change this to a varying [[Voltage]]

In this circuit as the temperature increases the output voltage $V_{out}$ increases as the [[Thermistor|thermistors]] resistance drops.

The output can be inverted by swapping the components

Now, as the temperature increases the output voltage $V_{out}$ decreases.
