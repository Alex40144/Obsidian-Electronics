Power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred.

Measured in [[Watts]], power is the rate of doing work

$$P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{W}{Q} \frac{Q}{t} = VI$$
Where
- W is work in [[Joules]]
- t is time in seconds
- Q is electric charge in [[General/Coulombs]]
- V is voltage in [[Volts]]
- I is current in [[Amperes]]
