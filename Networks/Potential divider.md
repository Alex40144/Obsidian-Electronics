A potential divider or [[Voltage]] divider is used to produce a reference voltage from a common voltage.

If no current exits through $V_0$ then using [[Kirchhoff's First Law]] the current through $R_1$ and $R_2$ is equal.
Using [[Ohms law]] we can say that the current is equal to the voltage divided by the sum of the resistances
$$I = \frac{V_s}{(R_1 + R_2)}$$ Then the Voltage across R2 is
$$V_{R2} = I*R_2$$

Combining these two equations gives
$$V_{R2} = R_2*\frac{V_s}{(R_1 + R_2)}$$
Which is more commonly written as
$$V_o = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}*V_s$$
